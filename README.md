# Recycle-Guru

My first VR project in Unity. With hopes of creating more immersive experiences and sharing having loads of fun!

The game opens up at the front of a house, sitting in the middle of a forest; with a mountain in the distance. 

The player will immediately be drawn to a rather impressive set of recycling bins with trash around its base. 

The aim is to get the player to pick these up, put each trash into the correct recycling bin before heading inside. 

I utilised intractable assets, ambient sounds, SFX, contact sounds, particle effects... All in an aesthetically pleasing 3d world. 

Hope you enjoy it. This is just the first draft...
